Hi!

This is a simple video/audio player written in C++, using MFC and openCV.

Implemented: video and audio playing, buttons for play, pause and continue.

1. To compile the project, please download and unzip openCV 2.4.6 

Sorry I am using the old version.

Then put the "opencv" directory under D:\OpenCV

So it should seem like:

D:\OpenCV\opencv\build\...


2. To run the project, Please put a video directory (e.g. "movie") under the project.
